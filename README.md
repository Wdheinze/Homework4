# Homework4
Homework 4 was honestly really fun. When I first started out on it I found it to be quite irritating but later on after talking with the professor I found
that I really enjoyed coding this little text adventure. My story involves the wizard Reki. I did not include a photo of him as I wanted to let the viewer 
visualize him however they wanted to. I chose photos off of pixabay and pexels for this adventure. Please enjoy.
